<section class="container">
  <section id="trauma-informed">
    <h3>Trauma-Informed Therapy</h3>
    <p>
      This is the foundation rather than a specialty add-on. It means sessions are paced, consent-based, and attentive to safety, nervous system responses, and capacity. The focus is on stabilization, understanding, and choice, rather than pushing insight or exposure too quickly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="psychodynamic-attachment">
    <h3>Psychodynamic–Attachment-Informed Therapy</h3>
    <p>
      This mode explores how early relationships, attachment patterns, and unconscious processes continue to shape present-day experiences. We pay attention to patterns over time, relational dynamics, and what emerges in the therapeutic relationship itself, always with care and curiosity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="relational">
    <h3>Relational Therapy</h3>
    <p>
      Change happens in relationship. This mode emphasizes collaboration, emotional presence, and attunement. Sessions are shaped by what is happening between us as much as by what is being talked about, allowing patterns to be noticed and worked with in real time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="developmental-systems">
    <h3>Developmental &amp; Systems-Informed Therapy</h3>
    <p>
      People do not exist in isolation. This approach considers developmental stages, family dynamics, cultural and social context, and broader systems that influence distress and resilience. This is especially important in work with children, families, and caregivers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="play-therapy">
    <h3>Play-Based &amp; Creative Therapy (Children)</h3>
    <p>
      With children, therapy often happens through play, creativity, and embodied expression rather than conversation alone. This mode supports emotional regulation, communication, and relational safety in ways that are developmentally appropriate and responsive.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="nature-based">
    <h3>Nature-Based / Outdoor Therapy</h3>
    <p>
      Nature-based therapy works from the idea that our surroundings influence how we feel, think, and relate. Spending time in natural environments can support grounding, self-awareness, and a sense of belonging and choice. The work is always optional and guided by safety, consent, and clinical fit.
