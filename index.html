          <h2>
            Relational, grounded, nature-informed with room for humour when it helps.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Therapy with me isn’t rigid or clinical.
            It’s collaborative and shaped around your nervous system.
            I believe people heal best when they feel safe, seen, and supported and sometimes that means sitting with big feelings, and sometimes it means laughing at something you didn’t realize needed laughter.
            Humour isn’t forced here, but it’s invited.
            It softens tension, creates connection, and helps us breathe again.

          <h3>🍃 Relational & Attuned</h3>
          <p>
            The relationship is the heart of the work.  
            You can show up with tangled thoughts, heavy emotions, awkward silences, or unexpected jokes — all of it belongs.  
            We follow your pace, your comfort, and your internal rhythm.
          </p>

          <h3>🌱 Trauma-Informed</h3>
          <p>Being trauma-informed means honouring:</p>
          <ul class="center-list">
            <li>safety</li>
            <li>choice</li>
            <li>pacing</li>
            <li>consent</li>
            <li>your nervous system</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your “no” matters.  
            Your “slow down” matters.
            Your story unfolds on your timeline, not mine.
          </p>

          <h3>🌲 Nature-Informed</h3>
          <p>
            Nature brings grounding, metaphor, sensory regulation, and gentle movement.  
            It also occasionally gives us a dramatic squirrel — surprisingly therapeutic.  
            You don’t have to love nature to benefit from it.  
            Just being outside can make things feel softer and more spacious.
          </p>

          <h3>🌾 Somatic Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Feelings show up in the body before they find words.  
            We notice breath, posture, sensation, and what your system is communicating.  
            No forced mindfulness — just gentle awareness.
          </p>

          <h3>🍂 Curiosity, Creativity & Humour</h3>
          <p>
            Healing doesn’t have to be solemn.  
            Sometimes curiosity, creativity, imagination, or humour opens doors that seriousness alone can’t.  
            With adults, this might mean a moment of levity in the middle of something heavy.  
            With kids, it often means play, movement, and embracing the unexpected.
          </p>

          <h3>✨ Paced for You</h3>
          <p>
            Therapy doesn’t require you to be brave on command.  
            You can come exactly as you are and we’ll walk from there.
          </p>

  <h2>Who I Am &amp; Why I Practice This Way</h2>

  <p>
    I came to this work through a long-standing curiosity about how people make sense of what they’ve lived through — and how they continue to move forward while carrying it. I’ve always been drawn to the in-between spaces: moments of transition, uncertainty, and quiet unraveling, as well as the steady resilience people often don’t recognize in themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Counselling became a way for me to sit with complexity alongside others, rather than rushing toward answers or solutions.

          <h2>My Approach &amp; Values</h2>

          <p>
            My approach is grounded in the belief that healing is not linear and that meaningful change happens in relationship. In sessions, clients can expect a pace that is collaborative, thoughtful, and attentive to their nervous system and lived context.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work from a trauma-informed, psychodynamic-attachment lens, informed by relational, developmental, feminist, and systems perspectives. Curiosity, reflection, and respect guide the work, with an emphasis on creating space that feels steady, supportive, and responsive to each person’s unique rhythm.
