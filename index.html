          <h2>
            Relational, grounded, nature-informed with room for humour when it helps.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Therapy with me isn’t rigid or clinical.
            It’s collaborative and shaped around your nervous system.
            I believe people heal best when they feel safe, seen, and supported and sometimes that means sitting with big feelings, and sometimes it means laughing at something you didn’t realize needed laughter.
            Humour isn’t forced here, but it’s invited.
            It softens tension, creates connection, and helps us breathe again.

          <h3>🍃 Relational & Attuned</h3>
          <p>
            The relationship is the heart of the work.  
            You can show up with tangled thoughts, heavy emotions, awkward silences, or unexpected jokes — all of it belongs.  
            We follow your pace, your comfort, and your internal rhythm.
          </p>

          <h3>🌱 Trauma-Informed</h3>
          <p>Being trauma-informed means honouring:</p>
          <ul class="center-list">
            <li>safety</li>
            <li>choice</li>
            <li>pacing</li>
            <li>consent</li>
            <li>your nervous system</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your “no” matters.  
            Your “slow down” matters.
            Your story unfolds on your timeline, not mine.
          </p>

          <h3>🌲 Nature-Informed</h3>
          <p>
            Nature brings grounding, metaphor, sensory regulation, and gentle movement.  
            It also occasionally gives us a dramatic squirrel — surprisingly therapeutic.  
            You don’t have to love nature to benefit from it.  
            Just being outside can make things feel softer and more spacious.
          </p>

          <h3>🌾 Somatic Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Feelings show up in the body before they find words.  
            We notice breath, posture, sensation, and what your system is communicating.  
            No forced mindfulness — just gentle awareness.
          </p>

          <h3>🍂 Curiosity, Creativity & Humour</h3>
          <p>
            Healing doesn’t have to be solemn.  
            Sometimes curiosity, creativity, imagination, or humour opens doors that seriousness alone can’t.  
            With adults, this might mean a moment of levity in the middle of something heavy.  
            With kids, it often means play, movement, and embracing the unexpected.
          </p>

          <h3>✨ Paced for You</h3>
          <p>
            Therapy doesn’t require you to be brave on command.  
            You can come exactly as you are and we’ll walk from there.

            Welcome - I'm Alexandra
          </h2>
          <p>
            I offer nature-based, indoor, and virtual therapy that moves at your pace.
  My work is trauma-informed, relational, and grounded in curiosity and humour because being human is beautifully complicated, and healing needs space to breathe.
  Whether you’re navigating overwhelm, burnout, trauma, relationship shifts, or simply the sense that something needs to change, you don’t have to do it alone. We can explore it outdoors, indoors, or online wherever your nervous system feels most supported.
