          <h4>Land Acknowledgement</h4>
          <p>
          I acknowledge that my work through Seasons Within takes place on the unceded, traditional territories of the Kwantlen, Katzie, Matsqui, and Semiahmoo First Nations. I offer this acknowledgement with respect for the land, the waterways, and the people who have cared for them since time immemorial, and as an invitation to ongoing reflection, responsibility, and relationship.
