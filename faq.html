<section class="container faq-section">


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What’s your cancellation policy?</summary>
<p>If you need to cancel or reschedule a session, I ask for 24 hours’ notice. This allows the time to be offered to someone else and helps support the sustainability of the practice.</p>
<p>Cancellations made with less than 24 hours’ notice, or missed appointments, are typically billed at the full session rate, except in cases of emergency or unexpected circumstances. These situations can be discussed with care and discretion.</p>
<p>Appointments can be cancelled or changed through the online booking system (Jane) or by email. My intention with this policy is not rigidity, but clear and respectful boundaries that support both clients and the work itself.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>How do I know if a counsellor is a good fit?</summary>
<p>A good therapeutic fit is less about finding the “right” therapist and more about how safe, understood, and respected you feel in the space.</p>
<p>Fit includes both practical considerations and relational ones. A brief consultation can offer a low-pressure way to explore whether working together feels like a good fit.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Where are sessions located?</summary>
<p>Services are offered outdoors at Williams Park, online across British Columbia, or by telephone when appropriate.</p>
<p>In-office sessions are available through a partner clinic. Please reach out to discuss availability.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What areas are you trained in?</summary>
<ul>
<li>Trauma and complex trauma</li>
<li>Stress, burnout, and nervous-system overwhelm</li>
<li>Anxiety and emotional regulation</li>
<li>Life transitions and identity shifts</li>
<li>Relationship and attachment concerns</li>
<li>Parenting and family dynamics</li>
<li>Child and adolescent mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>My work is informed by psychodynamic-attachment, relational, developmental, feminist, and systems perspectives.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Why is a single session the same rate as ongoing therapy?</summary>
<p>Single-session work involves the same level of care, responsibility, and clinical judgment as ongoing therapy. The rate reflects the quality of the work, not the number of sessions.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Why are consent and confidentiality important?</summary>
<p>Consent and confidentiality are foundational to ethical therapy. They support trust, autonomy, and transparency, within clearly defined legal and ethical limits.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Do you only work with first responders?</summary>
<p>No. While working with first responders is an area of interest, my practice supports adults, adolescents, children, and families across a wide range of concerns.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What if therapy isn’t working for me?</summary>
<p>It’s okay to name when therapy doesn’t feel helpful. Therapy works best when there is room for honest feedback, collaboration, and choice.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>How will I know therapy is working?</summary>
<p>Progress often shows up through subtle shifts — increased awareness, steadiness, or clarity — rather than dramatic change.</p>
</details>


<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What happens if I need to cancel a session?</summary>
<p>
• More than 48 hours’ notice: no fee<br>
• 24–48 hours’ notice: $75 fee<br>
• Less than 24 hours’ notice or missed sessions: full session fee
</p>
<p>Cancellations can be made through Jane or by email.</p>
