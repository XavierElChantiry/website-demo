<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section class="container">
<div class="center-head">
<div class="lined-title">Supervision</div>
<p>
This page describes <strong>clinical supervision</strong>, not therapy. Supervision is offered as a reflective,
collaborative space for counsellors to deepen clinical judgment, strengthen ethical decision‑making, and
develop a sustainable relationship to their work.
</p>
</div>


<p>
My approach to supervision is trauma‑informed, relational, and ethically grounded, with attention to
person‑of‑the‑therapist, nervous system awareness, and the real‑world contexts clinicians are practicing
within. Supervision is held with care for accountability and support, curiosity and clarity.
</p>


<p>
Supervision is available for pre‑licensed clinicians, interns, and early‑career counsellors, as well as
experienced practitioners seeking consultation or reflective practice. Formats include individual and
group supervision, offered virtually, with outdoor or walk‑and‑talk options available when appropriate.

<!-- REFLECTIVE SUPERVISION -->
<p>
I see supervision as a space to develop clinical judgment, ethical reflexivity, and sustainability, rather
than a place focused solely on technique or compliance. Who we are in the room matters as much as what we
know, and supervision offers a place to hold both with care.
</p>
</section>


<!-- EXPERIENCE -->
<section class="container">
<div class="center-head">
<div class="lined-title">Experience & Orientation</div>
</div>


<p>
Alongside my clinical work, I am deeply engaged in supervision, mentorship, and consultation. I have
supported interns, early‑career clinicians, and peers in both agency and private practice settings, and
have facilitated peer consultation spaces that balance accountability with care.
</p>


<p>
Seasons Within is shaped by my respect for nature, cycles, and seasons — both literal and metaphorical.
Healing is rarely linear. Growth includes rest. Change happens in relationship. These ideas inform the way
I approach supervision, creating spaces that are grounded, thoughtful, and spacious enough to hold
complexity.
</p>
</section>


<!-- CREDENTIALS -->
<section class="container">
<div class="center-head">
<div class="lined-title">Supervision Credentials & Scope</div>
</div>


<p>
I am currently approved to provide clinical supervision and am awaiting Certified Clinical Supervisor
(CCS) designation, while actively working toward Approved Clinical Supervisor (ACS) credentials. My
supervision practice is informed by ongoing training, consultation, and adherence to professional and
ethical standards.
</p>


<p>
Supervision is offered with transparency about scope and status, and with care for the requirements of
each supervisee’s regulatory body. If you have questions about supervision hours, documentation, or
designation requirements, we can review these together to ensure clarity and fit.
</p>

<!-- WHO IT'S FOR -->
<section class="container">
<div class="center-head">
<div class="lined-title">Who This Supervision Is For</div>
</div>


<ul class="center-list">
<li>A pre‑licensed clinician or intern working toward registration hours</li>
<li>An early‑career counsellor seeking support with case conceptualization, confidence, and clinical decision‑making</li>
<li>A clinician working with trauma or complex presentations, including vicarious trauma and ethical complexity</li>
<li>A private practice counsellor navigating scope, boundaries, documentation, sustainability, or burnout</li>
<li>Someone seeking reflective or relational supervision rather than supervision focused solely on administration or checklists</li>
</ul>


<p>
Supervision is collaborative and paced, with attention to both clinical work and the person‑of‑the‑therapist.
If you’re unsure whether this style of supervision is a good fit, a brief consultation can help clarify next
steps.
